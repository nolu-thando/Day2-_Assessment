Question 1:
Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control helps you with managing code over time. 
Commiting - when you the records changes.
Branching - Allows developers to work on different parts of code at the same time.
Merging - Combines chnages from different branches to the main branch.

Question 2:
Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
When creating a new repository on Github you have to login into your Github and click on the "new repository" tab. Then you have to give your repo a unique and memorable name.
If you want to add a descripstion to your repository, you can do so because it is optional. THen you can choose if you want your repository to be private or public.
Then you can initialize your repository with a README file. Then do the last steop and create your new re[pository.

Question 3:
Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
A README file is important because it helps other people who want to acess your code to undersatnd what your project/repository is about. How to run or debug your code.  A well-
written README needs to have a project title, a well detailed description, installation instructions and troubleshooting steps.

Question 4:
Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each,
particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
A public repository is for everyone. Anyone is able to view your project code, clone and download your repository. 
People can also see how many times you pushed into your project and see your commits.
A private repository is for your eyes only. The repository is only visible to you, no one can access your repository and no one can request to pull your files.
Public Repository disadvantages and advantages:
- Having collaborations
- Wider code visibility
- A lot of community contributions
- No privacy
- Exposes sensetive code.
Private Repository disadvantages and advantages:
- Protects sensetive code
- Gives you great control over who can view and modify the project
- Limits collaboration
- Hinders community contibutions

Question 5
Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
